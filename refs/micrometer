The @Timed annotation, commonly found in frameworks like Micrometer for metrics collection, includes default tags to provide context about the timed operation. The default tags are typically:
class: The fully qualified name of the class containing the timed method.
method: The name of the timed method.
exception: The class name of any exception thrown during the execution of the timed method. This tag is only present if an exception occurs.
